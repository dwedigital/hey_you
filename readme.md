# C# 1 - Hey You

This is an introductory exercise to help you practice creating a new console application and experimenting with variables and console input/output.


1. Create a new git repository for your project

2. Create a new console application

3. Add a line to the main method to print the text “Hello World!”

4. Ask the user for their name and change the message to “Hello, <name>!”

5. Ask the user a yes or no question such as “Are you having a good day?”

6. If they answer yes, display a response of your choosing

7. If they answer no, display an alternative response of your choosing

* Update your program so it picks a random question from a set of at least 3, and so that it gives positive/negative answers that correspond to each question accordingly
